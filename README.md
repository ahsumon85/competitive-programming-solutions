## Sum of First n Natural Numbers

We will discuss here how to find the sum of first n natural numbers.

Let S be the required sum.

Therefore, S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + .................... + n

Clearly, it is an Arithmetic Progression whose first term = 1, last term = n and number of terms = n.

Therefore, S = n/2(n + 1), [Using the formula S = n/2(n+1)
